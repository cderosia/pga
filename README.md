Exploratory Data Analysis of PGA Tournament Data using R

I have been an avid golfer my entire life. I have enjoyed both watching and playing golf. 
At the time of this project I still compete in amatuer tournaments at local, state, and national level. 
I have always been interested in digging deeper analytically into professional golf statistics.

I did this project independently aside from data collection. 
The data I used was gathered by Billy Kilduff in 2021 and is cited below. 
This data set contains data from 2018-2021.

You can view the raw code via the Rmd file. 
You can view the raw data via the csv file.
You can view the complete analysis via the html file. 

I answer various questions that I came up with in order to further understand the data. At this current point in time, I do not have the necessary machine learning knowledge to model and predict, however I am currently learning those skills and when I feel like I've learned what I need to, I will come back to this project and build simple predictive models for this data.
