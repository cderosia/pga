EDA of PGA Tournament Data

I have been an avid golfer my entire life. I have enjoyed both watching and playing golf. 
At the time of this project I still compete in amatuer tournaments at local, state, and antional level. 
I have always been interested in digging deeper analytically at what seperates those who are making cuts and winning tournaments from the rest of the field.

I did this project independently aside from data collection. 
The data I used was gathered by Billy Kilduff in 2021 and is cited below. 
This data set contains data from 2018-2021.
